 
Bugs so far:

- initial velocity: Possible- Turbine issues. 
Cases:[0,1,0], [0,0,1], [1,0,0]
- initial euler angles: They might be wrong 
- stop conditions at 90 degrees.  
- Moment Override creates pitching somehow from nowhere. 
- angle between two vectors acos bug - Fixed by calculating it via atan2

modifying to see if I can.
