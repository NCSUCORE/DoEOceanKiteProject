# DoEOceanKiteProject
Welcome to the DoE Ocean Kite Project repository. This code is being developed by several labs at NC State University with
the Control and Optimization for Renewables and Energy Efficiency (CORE) Lab leading.  
## If you are on the project team and you are looking for documentation, it can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/NCSUCORE/DoEOceanKiteProject/wiki).  
# _The code is currently under development and not really meant for public consumption._  
If you have stumbled upon this repository because you are interested in ocean current energy extraction and are looking for 
software to simulate an ocean kite, you may be interested in looking at the code but you will probably not be able to run it.
But check back for updates. When the code is ready for a first release we will update this readme with instructions for installing
and running.
