function results = avlLoadResults(fileName)
%% loadAVLResults(fileName) file to load output files from AVL
% Returns output as a structure with fieldnames that match the fieldnames
% of the file, subject to variable naming conventions.  Note that
% apostrophes and backslashes (commonly used in files) will be replaced
% with hexidecimal character codes (eg 0x2F etc.)

% I have only validated that this works on the output of the FT command in
% AVL.  I have not checked that any fields are not being accidentally
% redundantly written (due to redundant variable names) in the results of
% the ST or SB commands from AVL. -MC
