# Simulink Utils

The Simulink Utils App provides a number of utility tools that enhance the Simulink experience. It is intended to

* add shortcut keys to frequently used features,
* automate repetitive, generic or labor intensive tasks,
* add features that are not available in default Simulink  

and keep the customizations organized.  
  
  
  
An example application and more details can be found in our blog [here](http://monkeyproofsolutions.nl/en/how-to-keep-your-simulink-customizations-organized/).  
  
  
  
Documentation on the included features and on adding your own customizations can be found on the project [wiki](https://github.com/MonkeyProof-Solutions-BV/Simulink-Utils/wiki/Documentation#documentation).
